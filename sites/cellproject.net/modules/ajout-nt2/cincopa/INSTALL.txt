INSTALLATION
------------

1. Install Cincopa module
   
   Unpack the module in your sites module directory. Then browse to 
   "Administer" -> "Modules" and enable the module.
   (It's in the "Input Filters" section)
   
2. Set the permissions "manage cincopa galleries" for trusted users only

3. Configure the input filter

   To get the module to function, you'll need to add the Cincopa Filter
   to every Input Format you wish to use it with.
   
   To do so:
     1. Visit the "Input Formats" page (Administer->Configuration->Content Authoring->TextFormats)
     2. Click "Configure" for the desired Input Format
     3. Mark the checkbox next to "Parse Cincopa Tags" (Inside the "Filters")
     4. Click on "Save configuration"
   
   And that's it!
   You can now use the [cincopa 123456789] tag on every node which uses the
   Input Format you've attached the Cincopa Filter to.
   
4. Create new galleries!

   Visit the settings page at "admin/content/cincopa/galleries" and start
   creating galleries, or do so on the Cincopa website directly at:
   http://www.cincopa.com
